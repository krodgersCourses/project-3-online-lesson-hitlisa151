  <h2>Lesson Objectives</h2>
<p>Students will approximate definite integrals using Riemann sums and interpret the limit of these sums as the exact area under a curve, connecting this process to the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.

  <h3>Lesson Overview</h3>
  <p>In this lesson, you will be estimating the area under a curve using Reimann Sums. You will then use the concept of limits to 
    to understand how the exact area under a curve is the limit of Reimann Sums as the width of the rectangle approaches 0.
